# Types of Malware

**Purpose of Malware = Monetary Goal :money_with_wings: is the #1 reason**

**Virus:** Attaches itself to a program, usually an executable file, .Exe must be opened or running, no human action means the virus doesn't spread.

**Trojan Horse:** Most common, software with a desired function, misleads users of its true intent (for example, fake login screens)

**Ransomware:** Encrypts files, malware makes PC not available until Ransom is paid.

**Logic Bombs:** Predefined event time/day, script or code results in a lot of problems and disruptions when it's executed

**Spyware:** Trojan horse like software, records browsing, key strokes, and sends it to the attacker, (sometimes it may come with a bundle software, making the user unaware)

**Grayware:** Accepted through EULA, behaves like Spyware/Trojan

**Rootkits:** Backdoor access, software allowing in and out access without being detected

**Hoaxes:** Message warning the recipient of a non-existent computer virus/threat, false information, news which results in a DoS attack.


# TCP/IP Model: #

# More details about each layer:
**Application:** Allows programs to connect to our network

**Presentation:** Encrypt/Decrypt data for humans to read on screen, translates packages of data into another form, raw data into a certain format

**Session:** Whoâ€™s allowed to talk and when, performs a handshake with another computer, control connections between computers establish, terminate, manage connections, regulate who can send what, and how much, coordinates the conversation, and controls/manages layers 1 through 4

**Transport:** Sessions into packets, manage and control data packets, transfer of data, transfer of data, TCP = Transmission Control Protocol (receipt), UDP = User Datagram Protocol (no receipt)

**Network:** IP address to router, packages the data into packets, you can change the IP #, IP used to transfer data to a computer on a different network, NIC = IP and MAC Address

**Data Link:** Mac address to switch or router, bits into frames, transfer from point to point access from a computer to a device, packages those bits/data into frames, Media Access Control Address

**Physical:** Cables, turns data into bits, physical/electrical stage, conversion from Data to signals, pinouts, voltages, code, specifications, NIC
