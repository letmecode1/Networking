# Types of Malware

Purpose = Monetary Goal

**Virus:** Attachs itself to a program, .Exe must be opened or running, no human action means the virus doesn't spread.
**Trojan Horse:** Most common, software with a desired function, misleads users of its true intent (for example, fake login screens)

**Ransomware:** Encrypts files, malware makes PC not available until Ransom is paid.

**Logic Bombs:** Predefined event time/day, script or code reults in a lot of problems and disruptions when it's executed

**Spyware:** Trojan horse like software, records browsing, key strokes, and sends it to the attacker, (sometimes it may come with a bundle software, making the user unaware)
